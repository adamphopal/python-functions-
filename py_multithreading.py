#Functional Programming in Python: Parallel Processing with "concurrent.futures"
#We'll take the example data set based on an immutable data structure that we
#previously transformed using the built-in "map" function.
#But this time we'll process the data it in parallel, across multiple threads
#using Python 3's "concurrent.futures" module available in the standard library.
